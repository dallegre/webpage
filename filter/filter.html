	  This is a page about a filter module that I made.  It has the Moog transistor ladder topology.  The intent behind this filter was to make as nice of a transistor ladder as possible, aiming for ideal behavior, low noise and low unintended distortion as opposed to aiming to be a copy of a vintage circuit.  The characteristics and features are best described in a demo video (coming soon).</br>
