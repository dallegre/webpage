		  This <a href="../motion/motion.html">page</a> is based on a method I devised to create 3d objects on 
		  a 2 dimensional plane.  I thought it would be fun to invent a method to do this rather than look up
		  the canonical way to do it.  What I came up with is based on perspective.  
		  <br><br>
		  Initially a focal point is chosen.  Then a line of points that represent the cosest row of points is drawn.
		  A set of lines is drawn between each of those points and the focal point.  Along each of those lines, other 
		  points are drawn successively higher on the y axis.  As I increment further up (or "back" in the z dimension)
		  on the y axis, I decrease the distance between these points by a scaling function.  
		  <br><br>
		  This gives a grid that looks like it exists in 3 dimensional space.

		  The <a href="../motion/motion.js">script</a> also uses objects to create many circles that each have different
		  properties.  The object definition is called "Tracer".  Each Tracer object contains its own filter and circle.
		  At the instantiation of a new Tracer object, the cutoff frequency of the filter is defined and the radius of the 
		  circle is set.  These objects are instantiated in a list, allowing me to define a larger number of these 
		  objects than I would want to explicitly.  The index of the array is used to set the progressively
		  larger radii and the progresively lower cutoff frequencies.
